üîß SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE BREAKDOWN
1. Job Requirement Upload

Input: PDF, DOCX, or structured JD form.

Process:

Text extraction via PyMuPDF / pdfplumber / python-docx.

Normalize into structured fields (role, required skills, qualifications, etc.).

Storage:

Store JD text + parsed metadata in DB (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

Optional: Auto-classify job roles (e.g., using job title taxonomy like O*NET).

2. Resume Upload

Input: Student uploads resume (PDF/DOCX).

Processing:

Parse using PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, docx2txt.

Clean, normalize format (headers, sections, fonts).

Extract:

Name, education, experience, skills, certifications, projects.

Storage:

Raw text + structured JSON stored in DB (with link to student ID).

3. Resume & JD Parsing

Tech:

Use spaCy or custom NER models to extract entities (skills, orgs, degrees, etc.).

Normalize skill names using predefined taxonomy or embeddings + clustering.

LangChain can be used to orchestrate parsing chains:

JD Parsing Chain

Resume Parsing Chain

4. Relevance Analysis
üîπ Step 1: Hard Match

Tools: TF-IDF, BM25, fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz.

What to check:

Must-have skills ‚Üí strict keyword match

Good-to-have skills ‚Üí fuzzy match

Education match (e.g., ‚ÄúB.Tech CSE‚Äù)

Output: Binary/Fuzzy vectors

üîπ Step 2: Semantic Match

Pipeline:

Embed JD and Resume using LLM embeddings:

OpenAI Embeddings, HuggingFace (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2), or Cohere.

Use FAISS or Chroma vector store for fast similarity checks.

Cosine similarity gives semantic alignment.

üîπ Step 3: Scoring & Verdict

Scoring:

Final Score = 0.4 * Hard_Match + 0.5 * Semantic_Similarity + 0.1 * Education_Match


Verdict:

High Suitability: Score ‚â• 80

Medium: 60 ‚â§ Score < 80

Low: < 60

5. Output Generation

For Each Resume-JD Pair:

‚úÖ Relevance Score (0‚Äì100)

‚ùå Missing Skills / Projects / Certifications

üìà Improvement Suggestions (generated via LLM prompt, e.g., ‚ÄúBased on this JD, your resume is missing...‚Äù)

üü¢ Verdict (High / Medium / Low)

6. Storage & Access

Database:

Use PostgreSQL (structured data) + Redis (caching).

Tables: Resumes, JDs, Matches, Students

Search/Filter:

Filter resumes by:

JD Title

Relevance Score

Location / Skills / Education

7. Web Application
üîπ For Placement Team (Admin Dashboard)

Upload JD (PDF/DOCX/form)

View parsed JD info

View matched resumes (sorted by score)

Download CSV/PDF of shortlisted candidates

Filters: JD, score range, location, department

üîπ For Students

Upload resume

View match score + suggestions

Resubmit improved resume

To start prototyping this using FastAPI + LangChain, you'll need to log in to ChatGPT so we can use ChatGPT Canvas (a collaborative coding space). Once you're logged in, I can help you:

Set up the FastAPI backend structure

Create JD and Resume parsing routes

Integrate LangChain for LLM-based semantic matching

Define the relevance scoring logic

Design the database schema

Let me know once you're logged in, and we‚Äôll get started.
